# ChessPython

Here is a game done by Python
Rules:
The game is played on a chessboard which has 64 alternating squares in black and white.

Each player has 16 pieces: a king, a queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights and eight pawns.

The pieces move on the squares of the chessboard according to precise rules.

The king can move one square in any direction.
The queen can move as many squares as she wants in any direction.
Towers can move as many squares as they want in a straight line, vertically or horizontally.
Bishops can move as many squares as they want diagonally.
Knights can jump over other pieces and move in an "L" shape (two squares horizontally then one square vertically or two squares vertically then one square horizontally).
Pawns can move a single square forward, but capture diagonally. They can also advance two squares on their first move (but they cannot capture this way).
The player with the white pieces starts the game. Players alternate taking turns.

To capture an opponent's piece, you must move your own piece to the square where the opponent's piece is. The opposing piece is then removed from play.

The object of the game is to capture the opponent's king, which is called "mate". If the king is threatened and there is no way to escape, this is called "checkmate". If the king can escape, it is called "check".
